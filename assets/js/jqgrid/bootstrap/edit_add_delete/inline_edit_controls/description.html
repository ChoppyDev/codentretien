When a column is editable, you can select how end-users will edit it. This is controlled by the edittype property and current has five different options - text, textarea, select, password, checkbox.
<br><br>
In addition to that, you can specify the values end-users will see in name:value pairs in the editoption values property of Columns - this is especially useful for SearchType DropDown. Here is an example
<br><br>
"editoptions": {"value"=>"1:One;2:Two");
