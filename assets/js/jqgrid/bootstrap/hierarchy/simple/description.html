Simple subgrid is way to display quick a tabular data in master detail. In this case the detail data is just a information and nothing more. You can not sort, reorder and etc. Look into 2 level subgrid in order to do this.

The hierarchy is achieved in this example with adding another file and tell the main grid from where to get this data.

Note that the url of the subgrid is build dynamically.
