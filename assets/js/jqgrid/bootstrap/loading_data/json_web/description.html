This example demonstrates how we can load a JSON dataset from remote web-service or REST point - in our case StackOverflow - and bind it directly to the grid - all on the server side.
First fetch the JSON via a standard jQuery <b>$.ajax</b> call, then use a simple loop to transoform it to an array and bind it directly to the grid.
