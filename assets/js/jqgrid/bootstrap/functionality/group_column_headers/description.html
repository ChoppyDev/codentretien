		<div>Header grouping is a way to add additional columns above the header grid rows, so that they are grouped in a way you need them.</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
	We support two types of grouping - with colSpan enabled and colSpan disabled.<br/>
If the colSpan is disabled (the default) the headers that do not have grouping have a additional cell above it.<br/>
If the colSpan is enabled there is no additional cell above the non-grouped column and it is considered as one column.
