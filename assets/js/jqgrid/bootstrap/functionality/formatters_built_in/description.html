Cell formatters are a set of predefined formatters that can be applied to cells. They will format the cell text on the client-side and present it in a specific way. The list of currently available cell formatters includes Integer, Number, Currency, CheckBox, Link and Mail.
<br/>
Each formatter comes with its own set of properties, e.g. thousands separator, decimal places, target for links, etc. Please, take a look at the Code tab for samples.
