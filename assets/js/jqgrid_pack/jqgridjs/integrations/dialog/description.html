Searching (or also sometimes called "Filtering") is supported through the navigator option. This will bring a search dialog with common operations (equal, less or equal, greater, not equal, contains, etc).
<br/>By default we have simple search with multipleSeasrch to false
<br/>You can control the various aspects of the Search Dialog.
<br/> Note that we have bind different plugins which can help improving the search 
Some of these are datepicker, autocomplete and etc.
<br/> If the data is loaded via array or string - i.e local data - the search is performed automatically. If you use server side data you will need to build your own search procedure at the server.
